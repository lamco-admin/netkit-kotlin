# Patent Grant

**Lamco Development Additional Grant of Patent Rights Version 1**

Lamco Development ("Lamco") hereby grants to each recipient of the NetKit software ("Software") a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable (subject to the termination provision below) license under any Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software. For clarity, this license is granted only for the Software and not for any other Lamco product or technology.

## Definitions

**"Licensed Patents"** means any patent claims owned or licensable by Lamco that are necessarily infringed by the use or distribution of the Software alone or when combined with other software or hardware, but only to the extent the Software itself causes such infringement.

**"Defensive Termination"** means termination triggered by patent litigation as described below.

## Termination

The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice, for any recipient that makes any claim (including by filing a lawsuit, assertion, or other action) alleging that:

1. The Software, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, infringes any patent, or
2. Lamco has directly or indirectly induced infringement of any patent by the Software

This termination provision is intended to prevent patent aggression against the Software and Lamco.

## Scope

This grant does not:
- Cover patents that would be infringed only by modifications made by third parties
- Provide any rights to trademarks, trade names, or service marks of Lamco
- Grant any rights under patents covering any technology other than the Software itself

## No Warranty

THE LICENSED PATENTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

## Compatibility

This patent grant is supplementary to and compatible with the Apache License 2.0 under which the Software is licensed. In the event of any conflict between this patent grant and the Apache License 2.0, the terms most favorable to the recipient shall apply.
